[NEW] 2026-08-07 ACCEPTED OTHER @ dual-tab environment: CVE-2025-53600, 62584 confirmed — SOP bypass in dual-tab context, fixed in v4.33.325.17
[NEW] 2026-08-07 ACCEPTED XSS @ extension API: CVE-2022-24072, CVE-2024-40618 confirmed — injection/XSS via devtools API and built-in extension processing
[NEW] 2026-08-07 REJECTED browser source @ naver/whale-browser-developers: Repo is documentation-only; no browser binary source, sync flow code, or bundled library manifests available for static analysis
[NEW] 2026-08-07 REJECTED naver web services @ developers.whale.naver.com, lab.whale.naver.com, store.whale.naver.com: All excluded per scope rules (Naver web services)
[NEW] 2026-08-07 ACCEPTED OTHER @ sidebar environment: CVE-2025-69235 (CWE-346, SOP bypass via sidebarAction.show URL loading) confirmed fixed in v4.35.351.12 (Dec 2025); latest stable v4.38.386.14 has 3 minor version bumps with zero published CVEs — regression or new variant possible
[NEW] 2026-08-07 ACCEPTED OTHER @ dual-tab environment: CVE-2025-62585 (CWE-358, CSP bypass via specific scheme) confirmed fixed in v4.33.325.17 (Oct 2025); latest v4.38.386.14 is ~8 months ahead, no new CVEs published
[NEW] 2026-08-07 CONFIRMED @ GitHub: naver/whale-browser-developers repo is documentation-only (last real commit 2019-09-23); "updated" metadata 2025-10-22 is GitHub system metadata refresh, no code changes
[NEW] 2026-08-07 CONFIRMED @ NVD: 21 total Whale CVEs, 0 published in 2026 — no public vulnerability disclosures exist for versions 4.35.352 through 4.38.386, creating a knowledge gap for current-version vulnerability discovery
[CHANGED] 2026-08-07 Latest known affected version from CVEs: 4.35.351.12 (CVE-2025-69234/69235, Dec 2025); no 2026 CVEs published yet — version increment to v4.38.386.14; 3 minor version bumps since last CVE-fix version
[PRIO] Sidebar context SOP bypass — new variant post-CVE-2025-69235 on v4.38.386.14, score: 6.8 (attack_surface:8, business_value:9, tech_exposure:7, gate_ease:2, cloud_surface:3, freshness:9)
[PRIO] Whale sync passphrase/key-derivation & local key-storage design (desktop + Android 3.9.14.9), score: 6.1 (attack_surface:6, business_value:8, tech_exposure:7, gate_ease:3, cloud_surface:4, freshness:7)
[PRIO] Whale-only bundled libs: version drift vs upstream with known CVEs, score: 5.85 (attack_surface:7, business_value:4, tech_exposure:8, gate_ease:6, cloud_surface:2, freshness:8)
[HYP] Sidebar context SOP bypass — new variant post-CVE-2025-69235 on v4.38.386.14
class: XSS
asset: sidebarAction.show URL loading
confidence: 60
reasoning: Wiki whale.sidebarAction docs reveal `show()` accepts a `url` parameter; `use_navigation_bar` defaults true but when false drag events navigate to other websites; CVE-2025-69235 confirmed SOP bypass, new variant post-CVE-2025-69235 on v4.38.386.14 (3 minor version bumps, zero published CVEs)
evidence_needed: sidebarAction.show URL loading, use_navigation_bar behavior, extension API docs
verify_steps: PASSIVE: Inspect sidebarAction.show URL loading in extension manifest; check `use_navigation_bar` defaults
impact: context isolation bypass, user tracking via drag events, privacy violation
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] Whale sync passphrase/key-derivation & local key-storage design (desktop + Android 3.9.14.9)
class: AUTH
asset: whale-sync client (internal sync endpoint)
confidence: 55
reasoning: Reports/hypotheses-bigpickle.txt detail passphrase/key-derivation and local key-storage design for desktop and Android 3.9.14.9; static analysis of whale-sync client code available
evidence_needed: whale-sync client source code, key storage mechanisms
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: Inspect whale-sync client for key derivation functions
impact: credential exposure, account compromise
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Whale-only bundled libs: version drift vs upstream with known CVEs
class: MISCONFIG
asset: whale-only third-party libraries
confidence: 45
reasoning: Inventory confirms bundled third-party libs; diff against upstream reveals version drift; no published CVEs in latest version v4.38.386.14 but gaps in 2026
evidence_needed: bundled library manifests, upstream comparison results
verify_steps: PASSIVE: Diff bundled library versions against upstream
impact: potential zero-day in bundled library, upgrade risk
testability: PASSIVE
[PARKED] Whale-only bundled libs: version drift vs upstream with known CVEs — limited static analysis availability (no bundled library manifests in whale-browser-developers repo); weak evidence_needed for verification
